# Gesture_remote-control-application
Android application with the function of a remote control operated by gestures made with the smartphone

Android application that allows the execution of actions: 
- forward, 
- back, 
- home, 
- scroll up, 
- scroll down 
on a web page viewed by a browser on a second device.

There are two applications that communicate through a client-server connection. The first opens a web browser and with the other it is possible to carry out operations on the browser by making gestures with the smartphone. This is possible through the use of smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. There are also the two apk directly to be installed in two smartphones to test them. In the report the project is fully explained.

The language used is Java.
